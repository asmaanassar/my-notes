# How to Be Good Developer

*In this summary,* we will talk about things that software developers often face in the course of their careers, including these things:

- Creating software from scratch.
- Difficulty making modifications to some programs.
- Develop programs whose purpose is not understood.
- Facing errors during software development and the possibility of resolving them.
- Facing other errors while solving some errors.
- Doing some unnecessary things.

--*Most developers suffer from the previous things,--* but they must be confronted if necessary, so it is necessary to develop their way of thinking as developers to make the programs they develop easier for users to use, and easier to understand for other developers who may use it.
*So* there are some things that developers *should master* to avoid getting into developers' problems.

### 1- Understand the purpose of building the program

The developer must have complete knowledge about the purpose of building the program.

### 2- Objective of program design

This point means that the developer takes into account while building the program that the program serves the user and helps him as much as possible.

### 3- Not understanding the software used

The developer must know the software that he will use before building and designing any program.

### 4- Simplicity

Software developers must take into account while building and designing programs, simplicity and uncomplicatedness, because the purpose of building programs is to serve the user and not to complicate it.

#### In the end, in order to be an excellent lab developer, we have to take into account all the previous things.
